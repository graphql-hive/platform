# Hive Specifications

We encourage developers to help us with the developing and evolving Hive, since
[it's a full open-source project](https://github.com/graphql-hive/platform).

This page contains reference and information about the process of integrating Hive to other
frameworks or tools, usually as a new implementation of the
[Hive Client](/docs/api-reference/client) libraries.

## Specifications

If you wish to develop a new integration or a plugin for Hive, please refer to the following
specifications that might help you:

- [Publishing GraphQL schemas to Hive from a running service](/docs/specs/schema-reports)
- [Usage Reporting to Hive](/docs/specs/usage-reports)

## Future Development

We are tracking the process of development of new integrations using GitHub. Here's a list of
relevant issues, in case you wish to track, subscribe, or share your use-case:

- [Python Client for Graphene and Strawberry](https://github.com/graphql-hive/platform/issues/508)
- [Golang Client](https://github.com/graphql-hive/platform/issues/474)
- [Java Client for GraphQL-Java and DGS](https://github.com/graphql-hive/platform/issues/1430)

If you are looking for an integration that does not exists on that list, or you wish to collaborate
with us on the development of a new integration/plugin, please
[open a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/graphql-hive/platform/issues/new).
