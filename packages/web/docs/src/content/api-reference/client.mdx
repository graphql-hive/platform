# Hive Client

**Hive Client** is a set of libraries and utilities for interacting with Hive, for both
[Schema Registry](../schema-registry/index.mdx) and
[Usage Reporting](../schema-registry/usage-reporting.mdx).

## Available Clients

### JavaScript / NodeJS Clients

Here's a list of official libraries for JavaScript and NodeJS:

- `@graphql-hive/yoga` ([npm](https://npmjs.com/package/@graphql-hive/yoga),
  [guide](/docs/other-integrations/graphql-yoga)) - Integration with GraphQL Yoga.
- `@graphql-hive/apollo` ([npm](https://npmjs.com/package/@graphql-hive/apollo),
  [guide](/docs/other-integrations/apollo-server)) - Integration with Apollo Server.
- `@graphql-hive/envelop` ([npm](https://npmjs.com/package/@graphql-hive/envelop),
  [guide](/docs/other-integrations/envelop)) - Integration with Envelop.
- `@graphql-hive/core` ([npm](https://npmjs.com/package/@graphql-hive/core)) - core library for
  interacting with Hive's **Schema Registry** and **Usage Reporting**.

You can refer to the following guides for getting started within your project, then revisit this
page for configuring the client to your needs.

#### Configuration

Refer to the
[`HivePluginOptions` interface](https://github.com/graphql-hive/platform/blob/main/packages/libraries/core/src/client/types.ts)
for complete list of options and configurations you can pass to the Hive JavaScript Client of
choice.

#### Client Information

By default, the client information is retrieved by looking up the `x-graphql-client-name` and
`x-graphql-client-version` headers in the HTTP request. For operations executed via the
`GraphQL over WebSocket` protocol, the client information is retrieved by looking for the `client`
key within the `connectionParams`.

You can fully customize how to retrieve the client information by passing a custom `clientInfo`
implementation.

You can pass a custom `clientInfo` callback to have full control on how you detect a client's
information.

```ts
useHive({
  usage: {
    clientInfo(context /* Your GraphQL execution context */) {
      const name = context?.headers?.['x-graphql-client-name']
      const version = context?.headers?.['x-graphql-client-version']

      if (name && version && typeof name === 'string' && typeof version === 'string') {
        return { name, version }
      }

      return null
    }
  }
})
```

The context object is the context object as used within the GraphQL execution. Depending on your
server framework and GraphQL protocol, the context object may contain different properties.

We recommend to always try to safely decode the context.

#### Excluding Operations

You can pass a custom `exclude` array to the `HivePluginOptions` to ignore specific operations from
being reported to Hive.

```ts
useHive({
  usage: {
    exclude: ['unwantedOperationName', 'anotherOperationName']
  }
})
```

#### Sampling

##### Basic sampling

With `sampleRate` option, you're able to control the sampling rate of the usage reporting. Setting
it to `0.5` will result in 50% of the operations being sent to Hive. There is no guarantee that
every operation will be reported at least once (see `atLeastOnceSampler`).

Default: `1` (100%)

```typescript
useHive({
  /* ... other options ... */,
  usage: {
    sampleRate: 0.6 // 60% of the operations will be sent to Hive
  }
})
```

##### Dynamic sampling

GraphQL Hive client accepts a function that returns a number between 0 and 1. This allows you to
implement dynamic sampling based on the operation's context.

If `sampler` is defined, `sampleRate` is ignored.

A sample rate between 0 and 1.

- `0.0` = 0% chance of being sent
- `1.0` = 100% chance of being sent.
- `true` = 100%
- `false` = 0%

The `samplingContext` object contains the following properties:

- `operationName` - The name of the operation.
- `document` - The operation AST.
- `contextValue` - The context value passed to the GraphQL execution.

```typescript
useHive({
  /* ... other options ... */,
  usage: {
  sampler(samplingContext) {
      if (samplingContext.operationName === 'GetUser') {
        return 0.5 // 50% of GetUser operations will be sent to Hive
      }

      return 0.7; // 70% of the other operations will be sent to Hive
    }
  }
})
```

##### At-least-once sampling

If you want to make sure that every operation is reported at least once, you can use the
`atLeastOnceSampler`. Every operation is reported at least once, but every next occurrence is
decided by the sampler.

Both `keyFn` and `sampler` are required and receive the same `samplingContext` object.

The `samplingContext` object contains the following properties:

- `operationName` - The name of the operation.
- `document` - The operation AST.
- `contextValue` - The context value passed to the GraphQL execution.

#### Persisted Documents

Hive client supports resolving persisted documents. For getting started please refer to our
[App Deployments (Persisted Documents) documentation](/docs/schema-registry/app-deployments).

##### Basic Configuration

For enabling you need to provide the `experimental__persistedDocuments` as follows.

```ts filename="Hive Persisted Documents Basic Configuration"
useHive({
  experimental__persistedDocuments: {
    cdn: {
      // replace <target_id> and <cdn_access_token> with your values
      endpoint: 'https://cdn.graphql-hive.com/<target_id>',
      accessToken: '<cdn_access_token>'
    }
  }
})
```

##### Allow arbitrary documents

By default, Hive client plugins will only allow executing documents that are registered in the
Schema Registry. If you want to allow arbitrary documents to be executed, you can set the
`allowArbitraryDocuments` option to `true`.

```typescript filename="Hive Persisted Documents Allow Arbitrary Documents" {8}
useHive({
  experimental__persistedDocuments: {
    cdn: {
      // replace <target_id> and <cdn_access_token> with your values
      endpoint: 'https://cdn.graphql-hive.com/<target_id>',
      accessToken: '<cdn_access_token>'
    },
    allowArbitraryDocuments: true
  }
})
```

Furthermore, you can also allow arbitraty documents based on the incoming HTTP request.

```typescript filename="Hive Persisted Documents Allow Arbitrary Documents Based on Request" {8-9}
useHive({
  experimental__persistedDocuments: {
    cdn: {
      // replace <target_id> and <cdn_access_token> with your values
      endpoint: 'https://cdn.graphql-hive.com/<target_id>',
      accessToken: '<cdn_access_token>'
    },
    allowArbitraryDocuments: context =>
      context.headers.get('x-arbitrary-documents') === '<my-secret-key>'
  }
})
```

##### Cache size

By default, the client will cache up to 10.000 documents loaded from the CDN in memory to avoid
redundant lookups and speedup reoccuring document executions. You can change this value by setting
the `cache` option.

```typescript filename="Hive Persisted Documents Cache Size" {8-9}
useHive({
  experimental__persistedDocuments: {
    cdn: {
      // replace <target_id> and <cdn_access_token> with your values
      endpoint: 'https://cdn.graphql-hive.com/<target_id>',
      accessToken: '<cdn_access_token>'
    },
    // Cache up to 50.000 documents
    cache: 50_000
  }
})
```

#### Custom Integration

If your GraphQL server is not listed above, you can implement a custom integration. Start by
importing and creating a Hive instance using the `createHive` function.

```ts
import { createHive } from '@graphql-hive/core'

const hive = createHive({
  enabled: true,
  debug: true, // or, false
  token: 'YOUR-TOKEN'
})
```

Call `collectUsage` as soon as a GraphQL operation execution starts, and use the return value
callback when the operation ends. You may also wrap and replace the `execute` function with the
following:

```ts
export async function executeWithHive(args: ExecutionArgs): Promise<ExecutionResult> {
  // args is ExecutionArgs of graphql-js
  const finish = hive.collectUsage(args)
  // result is ExecutionResult of graphql-js
  const result = await execute(args)
  // Use this callback to finish measuring times, and save the operation report
  finish(result)

  return result
}
```

### Ruby Client

The [`graphql-hive` gem](https://github.com/charlypoly/graphql-ruby-hive) allows
[GraphQL-Ruby](https://graphql-ruby.org/) users to use Hive for usage reporting.

Refer to the following guides for integration with your project:

### PHP Client

The [Lighthouse Hive](https://github.com/stayallive/lighthouse-graphql-hive) is third-party
integration can be used to measure and collect data against all your GraphQL operations.
