# Deploying Hive Gateway to Cloudflare Workers

Hive Gateway a provides you a cross-platform GraphQL Server. So you can easily integrate it into any
platform besides Node.js.

[Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers) provides a serverless execution
environment that allows you to create entirely new applications or augment existing ones without
configuring or maintaining infrastructure.

<Callout>
  Before you start, make sure you read the [Serverless / On the
  Edge](/docs/gateway/deployment/serverless) page.
</Callout>

See [Bundling Problems](/docs/gateway/deployment/serverless#bundling-problem) for more details about
how to load the supergraph and `transports` option.

In the following example, we showcase how Hive Gateway can be used in a serverless environment with
Cloudflare Workers. Notice how the implementation leverages the `using` sytax for
[Explicit Resource Management](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/rpc/lifecycle/#explicit-resource-management),
this makes sure that the Hive Gateway is gracefully and properly disposed before completing the
worker.

```ts filename="index.js"
import { createGatewayRuntime } from '@graphql-hive/gateway-runtime'
import http from '@graphql-mesh/transport-http'
import supergraph from './supergraph'

export default {
  fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    const gateway = createGatewayRuntime({
      // All options available in `gateway.config.ts` configuration can also be passed here.
      supergraph,
      transports: {
        http // http transport is required for subgraphs using standard GraphQL over HTTP.
      }
    })
    ctx.waitUntil(gateway[Symbol.asyncDispose]())
    return gateway(request, env, ctx)
  }
}
```

```js filename="supergraph.js"
export default /* GraphQL */ `
  PLACE YOUR SUPERGRAPH SDL HERE
`
```

  If you want to use [Cloudflare KV
  Cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/kv) as a distributed cache, [see
  here for Hive Gateway integration](/docs/gateway/other-features/performance#cloudflare-workers-kv)
