# Hive Gateway

Hive Gateway is a fully open-source, MIT-licensed GraphQL router that can act as a
[GraphQL Federation](/federation) gateway, a subgraph or a proxy gateway for any GraphQL API
service.

As an alternative to Apollo Router, Hive Gateway provides a flexible, open-source solution tailored
to meet the needs of modern GraphQL architectures.

It supports deployment as a standalone binary, a Docker image, or a JavaScript package, making it
compatible with environments such as Node.js, Bun, Deno, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, or
Cloudflare Workers.

Our GraphQL API Gateway provides the following features on top of your GraphQL schema:

- [GraphQL Subscriptions](/docs/gateway/subscriptions) with WebSockets, HTTP Callbacks or SSE
- Automatic query and request batching to reduce the number of HTTP requests to your subgraph
- [JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](/docs/gateway/authorization-authentication) authentication between client
  and gateway also between gateway and subgraph
- [Authorization](/docs/gateway/authorization-authentication) on specific fields and types using
  Federation Auth directives like `@authenticated` and `@skipAuth`
- [Role-based Access Control (RBAC)](/docs/gateway/authorization-authentication) either
  programmatically or with directives `@requiresScope` and `@policy`
- [Response Caching](/docs/gateway/other-features/performance/response-caching) based on either in
  memory or Redis for distributed caching optionally with `@cacheControl` directive
- [Security](/docs/gateway/other-features/security) features such as safelisting, depth limit etc
- [Rate Limiting](/docs/gateway/other-features/security/rate-limiting) on specific fields and types
  either programmatically or declaratively with `@rateLimit` directive
- [Prometheus and OpenTelemetry integration](/docs/gateway/monitoring-tracing) with fully
  customizable spans and attributes
- [Persisted Documents](/docs/gateway/persisted-documents) backed by either Hive Registry or a
  selfhosting storage
- [E2E HTTP Compression](/docs/gateway/other-features/performance/compression) from the client to
  the subgraph for better performance and resource management
- [And more](/docs/gateway/other-features)

## Starting the Gateway

Hive Gateway supports two different modes:

- [**GraphQL Federation.**](/federation) Serve a supergraph provided by a schema registry like
  [Hive Registry](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/schema-registry), a composition tool like
  [Apollo Rover](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/),
  [GraphQL Mesh](https://graphql-mesh.com/) or any other Federation compliant composition tool such
  as [Apollo Rover](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/) or schema registry
  ([Hive Registry](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive),
  [Apollo GraphOS](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/))
- **Proxy a GraphQL API.** Hive Gateway can also act as a proxy to an existing GraphQL API.

<Tabs items={["Apollo Federation", "Proxy"]}>

{/* Apollo Federation */}

<Tabs.Tab>

To serve a [GraphQL federation](/federation) Gateway, we need to point the Gateway to either a local
supergraph file or a supergraph served by our schema registry. For this example, we will serve a
supergraph from the Hive schema registry.

<Tabs items={["Binary", "Docker", "JavaScript Package"]}>

{/* Binary */}

<Tabs.Tab>

```sh filename="Run Apollo Federation Gateway with the Hive Gateway Binary"
hive-gateway supergraph \
  http://cdn.graphql-hive.com/artifacts/v1/12713322-4f6a-459b-9d7c-8aa3cf039c2e/supergraph \
  --hive-cdn-key "YOUR HIVE CDN KEY"
```

</Tabs.Tab>

{/* Docker */}

<Tabs.Tab>

```sh filename="Run Apollo Federation Gateway with the Hive Gateway Docker Image"
docker run --rm --name hive-gateway -p 4000:4000 \
  ghcr.io/graphql-hive/gateway supergraph \
  http://cdn.graphql-hive.com/artifacts/v1/12713322-4f6a-459b-9d7c-8aa3cf039c2e/supergraph \
  --hive-cdn-key "YOUR HIVE CDN KEY"
```

</Tabs.Tab>

{/* JavaScript Package */}

<Tabs.Tab>

If you installed the JavaScript package, you can use `npx` for running the CLI.

```sh filename="Run Apollo Federation Gateway with npx"
npx hive-gateway supergraph \
  http://cdn.graphql-hive.com/artifacts/v1/12713322-4f6a-459b-9d7c-8aa3cf039c2e/supergraph \
  --hive-cdn-key "YOUR HIVE CDN KEY"
```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

</Tabs.Tab>

{/* Proxy */}

<Tabs.Tab>

In order to proxy a GraphQL API, we need to provide the URL of the API when starting our Gateway.
Optionally, we can also provide a schema file from either a local file or a schema registry, which
will be used instead of instrospecting the proxied API.

<Tabs items={["Binary", "Docker", "JavaScript Package"]}>

{/* Binary */}

<Tabs.Tab>

```sh filename="Run Proxy Gateway with the Hive Gateway Binary"
hive-gateway proxy https://localhost:3000/graphql \
  --hive-cdn-endpoint http://cdn.graphql-hive.com/artifacts/v1/12713322-4f6a-459b-9d7c-8aa3cf039c2e/sdl \
  --hive-cdn-key "YOUR HIVE CDN KEY"
```

</Tabs.Tab>

{/* Docker */}

<Tabs.Tab>

```sh filename="Run Proxy Gateway with the Hive Gateway Binary"
docker run --rm --name hive-gateway -p 4000:4000 \
  ghcr.io/graphql-hive/gateway proxy https://localhost:3000/graphql \
  --hive-cdn-endpoint http://cdn.graphql-hive.com/artifacts/v1/12713322-4f6a-459b-9d7c-8aa3cf039c2e/sdl \
  --hive-cdn-key "YOUR HIVE CDN KEY"
```

</Tabs.Tab>

{/* JavaScript Package */}

<Tabs.Tab>

```sh filename="Run Proxy Gateway with the Hive Gateway Binary"
npx hive-gateway proxy https://localhost:3000/graphql \
  --hive-cdn-endpoint http://cdn.graphql-hive.com/artifacts/v1/12713322-4f6a-459b-9d7c-8aa3cf039c2e/sdl \
  --hive-cdn-key "YOUR HIVE CDN KEY"
```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

By default, Hive Gateway will start a server on port 4000. You can customize that behavior. For that
please refer to our [Gateway documentation](/docs/api-reference/gateway-cli).

## Configuration File

The Hive Gateway config file `gateway.config.ts` is used for enabling additional features such as
authorization, authentication caching, rate limiting, and more. The recommended language for the
configuration file is TypeScript.

We can provide the CLI configuration parameters, also via the configuration file.

<Tabs items={["Apollo Federation", "Proxy"]}>

{/* Apollo Federation */}

<Tabs.Tab>

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  supergraph: {
    type: 'hive',
    // The endpoint of Hive's CDN
    endpoint: '<supergraph endpoint>',
    // The CDN token provided by Hive Registry
    key: '<cdn access token>'
  }
})
```

Hive Gateway will automatically load the default config file and apply the settings.

<Tabs items={["Binary", "Docker", "JavaScript Package"]}>

{/* Binary */}

<Tabs.Tab>

```sh filename="Run Proxy Gateway with the Hive Gateway Binary using configuration file"
hive-gateway supergraph
```

</Tabs.Tab>

{/* Docker */}

<Tabs.Tab>

For docker, we need to mount the configuration file into the container.

```sh filename="Run Proxy Gateway with the Hive Gateway Binary" {2}
docker run --rm --name hive-gateway -p 4000:4000 \
  -v $(pwd)/gateway.config.ts:/gateway/gateway.config.ts \
  ghcr.io/graphql-hive/gateway supergraph
```

</Tabs.Tab>

{/* JavaScript Package */}

<Tabs.Tab>

```sh filename="Run Proxy Gateway with the Hive Gateway Binary"
npx hive-gateway supergraph
```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

</Tabs.Tab>

{/* Proxy */}

<Tabs.Tab>

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  proxy: {
    endpoint: 'http://localhost:3000/graphql'
  }
})
```

Hive Gateway will automatically load the default config file and apply the settings.

<Tabs items={["Binary", "Docker", "JavaScript Package"]}>

{/* Binary */}

<Tabs.Tab>

```sh filename="Run Proxy Gateway with the Hive Gateway Binary using configuration file"
hive-gateway proxy
```

</Tabs.Tab>

{/* Docker */}

<Tabs.Tab>

For docker, we need to mount the configuration file into the container.

```sh filename="Run Proxy Gateway with the Hive Gateway Binary" {2}
docker run --rm --name hive-gateway -p 4000:4000 \
  -v $(pwd)/gateway.config.ts:/gateway/gateway.config.ts \
  ghcr.io/graphql-hive/gateway proxy https://localhost:3000/graphql \
  --hive-cdn-endpoint http://cdn.graphql-hive.com/artifacts/v1/12713322-4f6a-459b-9d7c-8aa3cf039c2e/sdl \
  --hive-cdn-key "YOUR HIVE CDN KEY"
```
