# Extend Your Gateway

Hive Gateway Runtime can be extended with feature flags and additional plugins. This allows you to
add more features to your Hive Gateway, such as rate limiting, caching, and more. This documentation
section covers most of the possible features that you can add with simple additions.

Hive Gateway also allows you to hook into the different phases of the lifecycle from the client to
the upstream services by using custom plugins that you can
[learn more here](/docs/gateway/other-features/custom-plugins).

<Callout>
  We'd recommend to check the available features and plugins on the left sidebar, because we believe
  some of them can be useful for your use case.
