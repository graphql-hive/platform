# Schema Policies

In addition to providing basic schema registry functionality, Hive allows you to define policies for
schema checks performed on your schemas. These policies can enforce semantic constraints or best
practices on the GraphQL schema, such as requiring a description on all fields or a specific naming
convention for all types.

Schema Policies are integrated into the schema `check` process of Hive. Every rule from the ruleset
have its own configuration and adjustments, and can have its severity:

- `warning` will display a emit a warning
- `error` will reject and fail the schema check

You can define policies on either the organization or project level. Organization-level policies can
be overridden on the project level, if allowed by the organization settings.

## Managing Policy Rules

Hive is using [GraphQL-ESLint powerful set of rules](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/eslint/rules) to
run checks on your schemas.

To find the list of all available rules, go to your **organization** or **project** page, and choose
**Policy** tab. You will see the list of all available rules, with the ability to enable/disable
rule by using the corresponding checkbox.

<NextImage
  alt="Schema Policy Overview"
  src={policyOverviewImage}
  className="mt-6 max-w-2xl rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

Once a rule is activated, you may configure the following options:

### Rule Severity

You can set the severity of the rule to `warning` or `error`. The default severity is `warning`.

<NextImage
  alt="Schema Policy Severity"
  src={policySeverityImage}
  className="w-sm mt-6 rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

A rule defined with `warning` severity will emit a **warning**, but will not fail the schema check.

A rule defined with `error` severity will emit an **error**, and will fail the schema check.

### Per-rule configuration

Every rule activated in the policy can be configured with the corresponding options. Some rules
might only have the severity option, but some rule can be configured with additional options to
ensure flexibility.

<NextImage
  alt="Policy Per-rule Configuration"
  src={policyRulesConfigImage}
  className="mt-6 max-w-2xl rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

## Policies Hierarchy and Overrides

When a schema is checked, the **target** policy and rules are calculated based on the following:

1. Organization-level policies (if any)
2. Project-level policies (if any)

Every rule that is defined on the project level overrides the corresponding rule defined on the
organization level (including all configurations and severity). **Per-rule configuration is not
being merged**.

When a policy is defined for the organization, you'll see an indicator on the project page, near
every rule that you override:

<NextImage
  alt="Override Policy Configuration"
  src={policyOverrideConfigImage}
  className="mt-6 max-w-2xl rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

In addition to the ability to override rules configuration or severity, you can disable rules that
were defined at the organization level by setting the rule severity to `off`.

<NextImage
  alt="Override Policy Severity"
  src={policyOverrideSeverityImage}
  className="mt-6 max-w-2xl rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

### Prevening overrides

If you wish to prevent overrides of your organization-level policies, you can do so by unchecking
the `Allow projects to override or disable rules` checkbox under your organization's **Policy**
page.

<Callout type="info">
  Disallowing projects to override the organization-level policies will prevent the projects from
  editing the project-level policy. If a previous policy has been set for the project, it will be
  ignored during schema checks.
</Callout>

## Integration with Hive CLI

Schema Policies is fully integrated into the Hive CLI, and you'll see both warnings and error coming
from the schema policies:

<NextImage
  alt="Hive CLI and Policy Warnings"
  src={cliPolicyWarningImage}
  className="mt-6 max-w-2xl rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

<NextImage
  alt="Hive CLI and Policy Errors"
  src={cliPolicyErrorImage}
  className="mt-6 max-w-2xl rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>
