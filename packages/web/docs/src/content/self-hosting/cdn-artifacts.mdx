# CDN Artifacts

By default, the self-hosted Hive instance does not come with a CDN, as this requires an external
service such as Cloudflare. However, you can enable fallback CDN route handlers that are exposed via
the `server` docker container.

<Callout>
  Please note that these route handlers are obviously not as performant and highly-available as a
  real CDN.

You need to set the following environment variables.

```bash filename="Environment variables for the server container"
# Enable the CDN API route handlers
CDN_API=1
# The (public) base url of the server container
CDN_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8082
```
