# Laboratory

Under your target page, you'll find the **Laboratory** page. The Laboratory allows you to explore
your GraphQL schema and run queries against a mocked version of your GraphQL service.

## Explore your GraphQL schema

You can use the full power of [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) directly within Hive:
compose your GraphQL operations, explore with different field and variations, and access your
GraphQL schema full documentation.

## Link a Laboratory Endpoint

You can link your actual GraphQL API endpoint to the Laboratory, so you can query for the actual
data.

You can set the GraphQL endpoint URL within the target settings.

Afterwards you can execute queries against your actual GraphQL API. Please make sure to set the
according CORS headers on your server for allowing the Laboratory to access your API from within the
browser.

## Built-in Mocks

You may execute operations directly from the built-in GraphQL, and the results will be fully
mocked - powered by
[GraphQL-Tools mocking capabilities](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/tools/docs/mocking).

Hive allow you to consume and use the Laboratory schema with your configured mocks while developing,
without running any GraphQL server or gateway.

1. [Up-to-date GraphQL Introspection](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/) for using with
   develpoment tools.
2. Mocks for executed GraphQL operations.

### Mock Endpoint

To get started with using the Laboratory mock schema externally, create a
[Registry Access Token](/docs/management/targets#registry-access-tokens). You only need to have the
`read` access to the target (or, use the **Schema Check Only** preset).

Now, click on the **Use Schema Externally** button on the Laboratory page, and follow the
instructions on the form:

<NextImage alt="Lab Form" src={labFormImage} className="mt-6 max-w-xl rounded-lg drop-shadow-md" />

To test access to your setup, try running a `curl` command to run a simple GraphQL query against
your mocked schema:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "X-Hive-Key: HIVE_TOKEN_HERE" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  LAB_ENDPOINT_HERE \
  --data-raw '{"query": "{ __typename }"}'
```

### With GraphQL-Code-Generator

<Callout>
  We recommend using the CDN for consuming the GraphQL schema in your project. [See GraphQL Code
  Generator Integration](/docs/other-integrations/graphql-code-generator).
</Callout>

Since the Laboratory schema is a valid GraphQL schema, and supports introspection, you may use it
directly with tools like [GraphQL-Code-Generator](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen). Here's a
snippet for using it in a project:

```ts filename="codegen.ts"
import { CodegenConfig } from '@graphql-codegen/cli'

const labEndpoint = 'LAB_ENDPOINT_HERE'
const labToken = process.env.HIVE_LAB_TOKEN

const config: CodegenConfig = {
  schema: [
    {
      [labEndpoint]: {
        headers: {
          'X-Hive-Key': labToken
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
export default config
```
