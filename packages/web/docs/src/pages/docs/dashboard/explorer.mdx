# Schema Explorer

The Hive Schema Explorer is a useful tool that can provide you with a comprehensive understanding of
your GraphQL schema. Not only does it allow you to explore the different types and fields of your
schema, but it also enables you to gain a deeper understanding of the arguments and their respective
input types.

## Schema Usage and Coverage

With [Usage Reporting](/docs/schema-registry/usage-reporting) feature enabled, you'll be able to see
an overview of the schema usage and coverage (for types, fields and input types), based on the
GraphQL operations you report to Hive.

This feature is useful if you wish to understand how your GraphQL schema is being used and queried,
and understand the impact of changes you make to your schema.

  plan](/docs/management/organizations#subscription-and-billing), and depends on the data you
  already sent before to Hive.
