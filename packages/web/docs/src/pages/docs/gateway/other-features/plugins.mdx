# Plugins

Hive Gateway is built with an highly modular architecture. The core is as small as possible, and
most of the feature are built around a plugin system.

A plugin can hook into each important steps of the lifecycle of the gateway, including the graphql
request execution.

The gateway is built using Graphql Yoga (a GraphQL HTTP server) and Envelop (a GraphQL execution
orchestrator), which are also highly modular technologies. Hive Gateway is extending Yoga and
Envelop plugin system by providing gateway specific hooks.

This means that if a plugin exists in multiple variants, you should follow this priority order:

1.  Hive Gateway: is aware of subgraphs and upstream request management.
2.  Yoga: is aware of the HTTP transport. It most of the time provides optimisations over the
    Envelop variants.
3.  Envelop: is only aware of the GraphQL operation execution.

For example, the Prometheus integration plugin is available for Envelop (`@envelop/prometheus`),
Yoga(`@graphql-yoga/plugin-prometheus`) and Hive Gateway(`@graphql-mesh/prometheus`). In this case,
you should pick `@graphql-mesh/prometheus` plugin. It is built on top of Yoga and Envelop variants,
but adds monitoring capabilities of upstream subgraphs.

For the most used features, you will not have to explicitly setup the dedicated plugin. They will be
added automatically based on your gateway configuration.

## Configuration

You can add plugins to your gateway using the `plugins` option.

It have to be a function, which will be called each time the gateway have update its configuration.
For example, if polling is enabled, this function will be called for each poll.

Most Hive Gateway plugins takes an object as a parameter, and expect some common components like a
`logger`, a `pubsub`, etc... Those components are given in parameters to the `plugins` function. It
is advised to spread the plugin's factory context into the plugins options, this way plugins will
have access to all components they need.

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { useGraphQLJit } from '@envelop/graphql-jit'
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'
import useNewRelic from '@graphql-mesh/plugin-newrelic'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  plugins: ctx => [
    useGraphQLJit(),
    useNewRelic({
      ...ctx
      // other options
    })
  ]
})
```

## Custom Plugins

You can take advantage of the plugin system to create your own custom plugin. This allows you to
integrate your gateway with any technology that we don't officially support, being public or private
to your company.

A good entry-point for discovering how to write Gateway plugins is to look at the source code of the
existing plugins maintained by us.

A plugin is an object that can define methods to hook into different phases or events of the gateway
lifecycle. Each hook will receive a single parameter, the hook payload, containing data related to
the hooked phase and functions allowing you to modify the behavior of this phase.

There are 2 categories of hooks:

- Gateway lifecycle hooks: they are related to the lifecycle or events of the server itself and is
  not related to a specific request.
- Request lifecycle hooks: they are tight to a specific phase of a specific request. Those hooks
  always give access to the related request in there payload.

### Gateway lifecycle

Gateway lifecycle allows to setup long running services, initialize in-memory cache or stores, react
to general events.

#### `onYogaInit`

It is the very first hook called just before the gateway starts listening for HTTP requests.

You can use this hook to customize the Yoga instance.

| Payload field | Description                                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `yoga`        | `YogaServer` instance that is about to start with the gateway. |

#### `onPluginInit`

Called before the server starts listening to HTTP requests.

In this hook, you can initialize every long running components, such as values stores, cache, third
party clients, etc...

You can add other plugin in this hook, which allow you to ensure plugins you depends on are present.

| Payload field                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `addPlugin(plugin: Plugin)`            | Allows adding a plugin to the plugin list. The new plugin will be added just after the one calling this function. It can be called multiple times, preserving plugin order.                              |
| `plugins: Plugin[]`                    | The current list of plugins. It can be used to verify if a dependent plugin is already in the list or to ensure your plugin is not present twice. This should never be mutated; use `addPlugin` instead. |
| `setSchema(schema: GraphQLSchema)`     | Allows replacing the current schema.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `registerContextErrorHandler(handler)` | Registers a handler that will be called if the GraphQL context factory throws an error. Useful for error reporting.                                                                                      |

#### `onSchemaChange`

This hook is called when the schema changes, either because the Gateway loaded it the first time, or
because a plugin changed it.

Possible usage examples of this hooks are:

- Monitor changes of schemas
- Analyse the schema or keep track of it for other hooks
- Modify the schema

| Payload field   | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `schema`        | The new loaded schema                                                                                                                                                   |
| `replaceSchema` | Replace the schema. This will trigger a new call to `onSchemaChange`, so you should keep track of schema already modified by your plugin to avoid infinite change loop. |

#### `onFetch`

This hook is called each time the `fetch` function is called. It can be either a request to an
upstream subgraph using the http transport, or a request made a plugin to a third party technology.

Possible usage examples of the hooks are:

- Manipulate HTTP [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) object
- Manipulate HTTP [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) object
- Change [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) implementation
- Add custom headers
- Monitor the HTTP request

| Payload field      | Description                                                                                                                                                            |

| `setUrl`           | Replace the target URL                                                                                                                                                 |
| `options`          | The `fetch` function options                                                                                                                                           |
| `setOptions`       | Replace the options that will be used to send the request                                                                                                              |
| `info`             | The GraphQL operation info                                                                                                                                             |
| `fetchFn`          | The fetch function that will be used to make the request. By default, it is the one provided in the Gateway configuration if provided, or `@whatwg-node/fetch` if not. |
| `setFetchFn`       | Replace the `fetch` function that will be used to make the request. It should be compatible with standard `fetch` API.                                                 |
| `executionRequest` | Present only if the request is an upstream subgraph request. It contains all information about the upstream query, notably the target subgraph name.                   |
| `requestId`        | A unique ID identifying the client request. This is used to correlate downstream and upstream requests across services.                                                |
| `logger`           | The logger instance for the specific request that includes the details of the request and the response.                                                                |

#### `Symbol.asyncDispose` or `Symbol.dispose`

In order to clean up resources when Hive Gateway is shut down, you can use `Symbol.asyncDispose` or
`Symbol.syncDispose` to clean up resources.

```ts
export const useMyPlugin = () => {
  return {
    async [Symbol.asyncDispose]() {
      // Clean up resources
      await stopConnection()
    }
  }
}
```

here.

### Request Lifecycle

The following diagram shows the lifecycle of request in Hive Gateway.

Each hook is given a single parameter called payload. Please see detail section of each hook to know
what contains each of this payloads.

### `onRequest`

This hook is invoked for ANY incoming HTTP request. Here you can manipulate the request or create a
short circuit before Yoga handles the request.

<Callout type="warning">

Exceptions thrown by this hook are not caught. This means they will buble up to the HTTP server
underlying implementation.

For example, the `node:http` server crashes the entire process on uncaught exceptions.

Prefer `onRequestParse` when possible, or wrap the hook code in a `try` block.

</Callout>

For example, you can shortcut the manually handle an HTTP request, short-circuiting the Hive Gateway
HTTP handler:

```ts
import type { GatewayPlugin } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

function useAuth(): GatewayPlugin {
  return {
    onRequest({ request, fetchAPI, endResponse }) {
      if (!request.headers.get('authorization')) {
        endResponse(
          new fetchAPI.Response(null, {
            status: 401,
            headers: {
              'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            }
          })
        )
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Possible usage examples of this hook are:

- Manipulate the request
- Short circuit before Yoga handles the request

| `serverContext` | The early context object that is shared between all hooks and the GraphQL execution. [Learn more about the context](/docs/features/context).    |
| `fetchAPI`      | WHATWG Fetch API implementation. [Learn more about the fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).                  |
| `url`           | WHATWG URL object of the incoming request. [Learn more about the URL object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL).             |
| `endResponse`   | A function that allows you to end the request early and send a response to the client.                                                          |

### `onRequestParse`

This hook is invoked for any incoming GraphQL HTTP request and is invoked before attempting to parse
the GraphQL parameters. Here you can manipulate the request, set a custom request parser or apply
security measures such as checking for access tokens etc.

Possible usage examples of this hook are:

- Manipulate the request
- Set custom GraphQL request parser (use custom GraphQL protocol)
- Apply security measures

| Payload field      | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `request`          | The incoming HTTP request as WHATWG `Request` object. [Learn more about the request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request). |

| `requestParser`    | The function that will be used to extract GraphQL params from the request.                                                                      |
| `setRequestParser` | Allows to replace the function that will be used to extract GraphQL params from the request                                                     |

### `onParams`

This hook is invoked for an incoming GraphQL request after the GraphQL parameters (`query`,
`variables`, `extensions` and `operationName`) have been ATTEMPTED to be parsed.

Within this hook you can manipulate and customize the parameters or even implement a whole new way
of parsing the parameters (if you wish to diverge from the GraphQL over HTTP specification).

In addition to that you could also short-circuit and skip the GraphQL execution. E.g. you might want
to serve a result from the cache instead.

Possible usage examples of this hook are:

- **[Response Cache](/docs/features/response-caching)**: Short-circuit GraphQL execution if response
  can be served from the cache.
- **[Persisted Operations](/docs/features/persisted-operations):** Load the `query` document string
  from the persisted operations store before running the execution.
- **[APQ](/docs/features/automatic-persisted-queries):** Load/persist the `query` document string on
  the persisted operations store.

| fetchAPI      | [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) provided in the Hive Gateway configuration. This should be used to make outgoing HTTP request, since it will trigger the `onFetch` hook. |
| `context`     | The server context. It can contain runtime specific data, such as `req` and `res` object when running in Node for example.                                                                                       |

### `onParse`

Called for parsing the GraphQL document. This hook has a before and after stage. You can hook into
before the document is parsed and/or into after the document is parsed.

**Example actions in this hook:**

- Replace GraphQL parser and support future GraphQL syntax
- Collect metrics about parsing success/failures

### `onExecutionResult`

This hook is invoked for each result produced for GraphQL operation, before it is processed to be
sent to client.

In particular, it is useful to handle batched operations. If a request contains batched operations,
this hook is called once of each operation, while `onResultProcess` will be only called once for the
entire request.

Here, you can modify the result, to add monitoring or instrumentation extensions for example.

**Example actions in this hook:**

- Add metadata to results
- Collect errors

### `onResponse`

This hook is invoked after a HTTP request (both GraphQL and NON GraphQL) has been processed and
after the response has been forwarded to the client. Here you can perform any cleanup or logging
operations, or you can manipulate the outgoing response object.

<Callout type="warning">

Exceptions thrown by this hook are not caught. This means they will buble up to the HTTP server
underlying implementation.

For example, the `node:http` server crashes the entire process on uncaught exceptions.

Prefer `onRequestParse` when possible, or wrap the hook code in a `try` block.

</Callout>

- Specify custom response format
- Logging/Metrics

### Plugin Context

Hive Gateway comes with ready-to-use `logger`, `fetch`, cache storage and etc that are shared across
different components. We'd highly recommend you to use those available context values instead of
creating your own for a specific plugin.

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  plugins({
    fetch, // WHATWG compatible Fetch implementation.
    logger, // Logger instance used by Hive Gateway
    cwd, // Current working directory
    pubsub, // PubSub instance used by Hive Gateway
    cache // Cache storage used by Hive Gateway
  }) {
    return [
      useMyPlugin({ logger, fetch }) // So the plugin can use the shared logger and fetch
    ]
  }
})
```

## Example Additional Plugin (SOFA)

GraphQL SOFA allows you to generate a fully documented REST API from your GraphQL schema. This is
useful when you need to support REST clients or when you want to expose a REST API to the public.

- **Don’t choose between REST and GraphQL**
- Get most of the **benefits of GraphQL** on the backend and frontend, while using and **exposing
  REST**
- **Support all your existing clients** with REST while improving your backend stack with GraphQL
- Create custom, perfectly client-aligned REST endpoints for your frontend simply by naming a route
  and attaching a query
- In the other way around (REST to GraphQL) you won’t get the best of both worlds. Instead just less
  powerful, harder-to-maintain server implementations with a some of the benefits of GraphQL. It can
  be a good and fast start for a migration though.
- Fully **generated documentation** that is always up-to-date
- **GraphQL Subscriptions as Webhooks**

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @graphql-yoga/plugin-sofa
```

## Quick Start

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'
import { useSOFA } from '@graphql-yoga/plugin-sofa'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  plugins: pluginCtx => [
    useSOFA({
      // The path where the REST API will be served
      basePath: '/rest',
      // The path where the Swagger UI will be served
      swaggerUIEndpoint: '/rest/docs',
      // OpenAPI Document details
      info: {
        title: 'My API',
        description: 'My API Description',
        version: '1.0.0'
      }
    })
