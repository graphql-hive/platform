# Single Sign On via OIDC (Open ID Connect Provider)

Hive allows you to connect any Open ID Connect provider (e.g. Okta, Auth0, Azure AD, or Google
Workspaces) to your organization. This allows you to use then existing Open ID Connect provider to
authenticate and automatically add your users to your organization.

Users signing into your organization will be automatically added to your organization and will be
able to access all the resources that you have granted them access to. Users that sign using the
Open ID Connect provider will only be scoped to that organization and incapable of creating
organizations or joining any other organizations.

This page will guide you through the process of connecting your Open ID Connect provider to your
Hive organization.

<Callout type="info">
  SSO is a core feature in Hive, and available for all subscriptions and plans, including free
  plans. [We do not gate any features behind a paywall](https://sso.tax/).

## Setup Instructions

<Steps>

### Connecting the OIDC Provider

<Callout type="info">
  Your OIDC provider needs to support the `email` claim capability in order to work correctly with
  Hive SSO.
</Callout>

Visit your organization **Settings** page and click on the **Connect Open ID Connect Provider**
button.

For the form, fill in the following information:

- **OAuth API URL**: The OAuth API url of your OIDC provider. This is the url that you use to sign
  into your OIDC provider. For example `https://trial-xxxxxx.okta.com/oauth2/v1`if you are using
  Okta as your OIDC provider.
- **Client ID**: The client id of your OIDC provider.
- **Client Secret**: The client secret of your OIDC provider.

Connect the provider by clicking on the **Connect OIDC Provider** button.

### Configuring your OIDC Provider

After creating the OIDC Provider the **Manage OpenID Connect Integration** modal will opened.
Alternatively you can click the **Manage OIDC Provider** button on your organization **Settings**
page.

This page will show the **OIDC Provider Sign-in redirect URI** (e.g.
`https://app.graphql-hive.com/auth/callback/oidc`) and the **OIDC Provider Sign-out redirect URI**
(e.g. `https://app.graphql-hive.com/logout`).

Go to the dashboard of your OIDC provider and set these values as the **Sign-in redirect URI** and
**Sign-out redirect URI** respectively.

### Login via OIDC

After creating the OIDC Provider the **Manage OpenID Connect Integration** modal will opened.
Alternatively you can click the **Manage OIDC Provider** button on your organization **Settings**
page.

That page shows the login URL that your users can utilize for logging in via the OIDC Provider.
Share this link with your users or add it to your SSO provider dashboard, so people will be
redirected to it.

Your login URL will look like this:

```text copy=false
https://app.graphql-hive.com/auth/oidc?id=xxxxxxxx-1234-1234-1234-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

You can also sign in by clicking the "Login with SSO" button on the login screen. Simply enter your
organization's slug, and you will then be redirected to your OIDC provider.

<Callout type="info">
  **Access to the organization is restricted to the OIDC accounts by default.** If you want to allow
  users to sign in with email and password, or any other auth provider, visit your organization
  **Settings** page and in the **OpenID Connect** configuration disable the **OIDC-Only Access**
  option.
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Integration Guides

### Okta

Once you're logged in to your account, click the **Admin** button in the header to navigate to the
admin view.

![Okta Admin Button](/docs/pages/management/sso/okta-admin-button.webp)

After you're redirected click on the **Applications** tab in the sidebar then click on the **Create
App Integration** button:

![Okta Create App](/docs/pages/management/sso/okta-create-app-integration.webp)

Choose **OIDC - OpenID Connect** as for the Sign-in method and **Web Application** for the
**Application type**, then click **Next**.

![Okta App Integration](/docs/pages/management/sso/create-new-app-integration-options.webp)

Next you're gonna be able to customize your app's name and logo if you want to, then choose the
option that suits you for the "Controlled access", I'm gonna go with "Allow everyone" as this's just
a guide, after you're done click "Save".

![Okta Controlled Access](/docs/pages/management/sso/controlled-access-of-okta-app.webp)

From the Okta dashboard, grab and store the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**:

![Okta Client ID](/docs/pages/management/sso/okta-app-config-client-id.webp)

![Okta Client Secret](/docs/pages/management/sso/okta-app-config-client-secret.webp)

And now you're almost good to go with Okta's configuration, now head to your Hive organization
settings tab and hit the **Connect Open ID Connect Provider** button

![OIDC Provider in Hive](/docs/pages/management/sso/hive-connect-openid-provider.png)

And now you'd have to fill in a couple of inputs to connect your OpenID Okta's provider as the
following:

![OIDC Modal in Hive](/docs/pages/management/sso/hive-connect-openid-provider-modal.png)

- **Token Endpoint**: `https://YOUR_OKTA_DOMAIN_HERE/oauth2/v1/token`
- **User Info Endpoint**: `https://YOUR_OKTA_DOMAIN_HERE/oauth2/v1/userinfo`
- **Authorization Endpoint**: `https://YOUR_OKTA_DOMAIN_HERE/oauth2/v1/authorize`
- **Client ID**: from Okta dashboard
- **Client Secret**: from Okta dashboard

After you're done, click the **Connect OIDC Provider** button.

The last step to do is, grabbing both the OIDC provider sign-in and sign-out redirect URIs by
clicking the copy button next to them.

In your Okta's app SSO configuration and scroll down to the **General Settings** section and click
**Edit** on the right, then scroll down to the **LOGIN** section and paste both the Sign-in redirect
URI and the Sign-out redirect URI from Hive into their responding inputs and click **Save** when
you're done.

![Manage OIDC in Hive](/docs/pages/management/sso/hive-manage-openid-connect-modal.png)

![Okta General Settings](/docs/pages/management/sso/okta-app-general-settings-section.webp)

And congrats, you now have Okta connected! ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰

You can use the link provided in the modal left section to let your users login via Okta.

![Hive Login URL](/docs/pages/management/sso/hive-manage-openid-okta-login-url.png)

### Azure

After you're logged in to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), find the **Azure Entra ID**. On
the left sidebar, click on the **Enterprise applications** under the **Manage** section:

![Azure AD](/docs/pages/management/sso/azure-ad-enterprise-applications.webp)

Then click on the **New Application** button and then click on the **Create your own application**
button afterwards, you're gonna see the panel on the right where you should provide a name and
select "**Register an application to integrate with Azure AD (App you're developing)**" as for the
application purpose, then hit the **Create** button.

![Azure AD](/docs/pages/management/sso/azure-ad-new-application-button.webp)

![Azure AD](/docs/pages/management/sso/azure-ad-create-application-panel.webp)

And now the last step to register your app is to define "**Who can use this application or access
this API?**" according to your needs, then choose **Web** as for the selecting the platform and
input `https://app.graphql-hive.com/auth/callback/oidc` in the input next to it, and finally click
**Register**.

![Azure AD](/docs/pages/management/sso/azure-ad-register-application.webp)

Once you see the successfully created application popup, go back to your enterprise applications by
navigating through the history structure from the top, then navigate to the **App registrations**
tab from the right sidebar, and now you're gonna see your app in the applications list, so click on
your app.

![Azure AD](/docs/pages/management/sso/azure-ad-go-back-after-app-registeration.webp)

![Azure AD](/docs/pages/management/sso/azure-ad-after-going-back-choose-tab-in-sidebar.webp)

And from here, we now have most of the configuration details needed by Hive for SSO connection, so
now head to your Hive's organization settings tab and hit the **Connect Open ID Connect Provider**
button:

![OIDC Provider in Hive](/docs/pages/management/sso/hive-connect-openid-provider.png)

And now you'd have to fill in a couple of inputs to connect your OpenID Azure AD's provider.

![OIDC Modal in Hive](/docs/pages/management/sso/hive-connect-openid-provider-modal.png)

Now, create a new client secret for your app by navigating as the screenshot illustrates then on the
right panel add a description for your secret and configure your expiration configuration or leave
it as the default recommended value which is `6 months`, then click **Add**:

![](/docs/pages/management/sso/azure-ad-app-new-client-secret.webp)

Copy and store your client secret value. Make sure to copy the value immediately, as you're not
gonna be able to see it again after navigating.

![](/docs/pages/management/sso/azure-ad-client-secret-value.webp)

Use the pointers in the screenshot to help you find your credentials to be able to fill Hive's
connection inputs:

![Azure AD](/docs/pages/management/sso/azure-ad-app-creds.webp)

- **Token Endpoint**: From the screenshot above
- **User Info Endpoint**: `https://graph.microsoft.com/oidc/userinfo`
- **Authorization Endpoint**: From the screenshot above
- **Client ID**: From the screenshot above
- **Client Secret**: The one you have just created.

After you're done, click the **Connect OIDC Provider** button.

And we're almost done, go to the "**Authentication**" tab and scroll done to the "**Front-channel
logout URL**" section, and fill in the input with the following URL:
`https://app.graphql-hive.com/logout`, then click **Save**.

![Azure AD](/docs/pages/management/sso/azure-ad-configure-logout-url.webp)

And for the last step, we need to add the permissions for Azure AD to be able to access the user
info after authentication, so use the "**API permissions** section on AD portal, then click the
**Add a permission** button, you're gonna see a right panel, choose **Microsoft Graph** then
**Delegated permissions**. And make sure to add all of the listed permissions by using the search
bar and checking the checkboxes:

- `email`
- `openid`
- `profile`
- `User.read`

After you're done, click the **Add permissions** button.

![Azure AD](/docs/pages/management/sso/azure-ad-configure-api-permissions.webp)
![Azure AD](/docs/pages/management/sso/azure-ad-configure-api-permissions-graph.webp)
![Azure AD](/docs/pages/management/sso/azure-ad-delegated-permissions.webp)

<Callout type="info">
  **Azure AD and `email` field access**

Granting the permission for `email` unfortunately doesn't guarantee a successful login, because in
Azure AD, the `email` field is marked as optional, while it's required for a successful integration
with Hive.

If your Azure AD members does not have the `email` field set, the login will fail. You can follow
the steps in the screenshots below to be able to add an `email` for an existing user record.

![Azure AD](/docs/pages/management/sso/azure-ad-users-tab.webp)
![Azure AD](/docs/pages/management/sso/azure-ad-users-table.webp)
![Azure AD](/docs/pages/management/sso/azure-ad-edit-user-properties.webp)
![Azure AD](/docs/pages/management/sso/azure-ad-edit-user-email-field.webp)

</Callout>

And congrats, you now have Azure AD connected! ðŸŽ‰

You can use the link provided in the modal right section to let your users login via Azure AD.
