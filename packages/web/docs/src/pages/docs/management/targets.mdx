# Target Management

Within a Hive **project**, you can create **targets** (which are equivalent to runtime environments)
and manage different schemas across different contextual runtimes.

When it comes to the GraphQL schema, every target is considered standalone, and can have different
states of the same schema, within the same GraphQL API project (just like different runtime
environments).

When a new Hive **project** is created, default targets are created (`development`, `staging` and
`production`). You can create more targets if needed, or remove the default ones if they are not in
use.

## Create a new target

From your Hive **project** page, you can see the list of targets created under the project. You can
also use the **New Target** button to create a new target.

### Conditional Breaking Changes

Conditional Breaking Changes is a concept that involves marking breaking changes in your GraphQL
schemas as safe, based on real-life data and traffic reported to Hive. This is done through the
[Usage Reporting](/docs/schema-registry/usage-reporting) feature.

When a new schema of your GraphQL schema is published to the registry, Hive uses the data collected
from your API gateway to identify whether the change in your schema actually affects consumers.

![Conditional Breaking Changes](/docs/pages/management/target-conditional-breaking-changes.png)

Under your target's **Settings** page, you can enable the **Conditional Breaking Changes** feature
and configure the following settings:

#### Traffic Threshold and Duration

You can choose to mark a breaking change as safe, if it affects some percentage of your traffic, in
a specific time range.

Here are a few examples and their meaning:

- **Traffic Threshold:** `0%`: A breaking change is considered as breaking and dangerous if the
  field was used at least once.
- **Traffic Threshold:** `10%`: A breaking change is considered as breaking and dangerous if the
  field was requested by more than 10% of all GraphQL operation.

<Callout type="info">
  The maximum duration is defined by the retention of your [Hive
  plan](/docs/management/organizations#subscription-and-billing).
</Callout>

#### Client Exclusions

Real-life data and traffic is collected from your API gateway can be annotated with specific
**Client**. In most cases, the **Client** matches a specific `User-Agent` and reported through the
Hive agent. You can read more about this in the
[Usage Reporting](/docs/schema-registry/usage-reporting) page.

You may choose to exclude specific clients from the **Conditional Breaking Changes** if you wish to
have more control over the process.

#### Cross-target Checks

When a new schema is published to the registry, Hive checks the usage of the field in the current
target. However, you may choose to also check the usage of the field in other targets.

This is useful if you wish to use the `production` target as a reference for the usage of the field,
while checking the schemas of other targets, like `staging` or `development`.

### Schema Extensions

Hive allows you to have a pre-defined GraphQL schema that is automatically merged with your
published schemas, before being checked and validated.

This feature is useful with some frameworks that defines internal GraphQL schemas, and doesn't
include it while exporting the schema to a file.

#### Schema Stitching Directives

If you are using
[Schema Stitching Directives](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/stitching/docs/approaches/stitching-directives),
you probably want to the core directives as schema extensions, and avoid pushing it through every
service.

You can find the complete definition of the
[Stitching Directives SDL in the documentation](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/stitching/docs/approaches/stitching-directives#directives-glossary)

#### AWS AppSync/Amplify

If you are using [AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/)
[AWS Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/), you are probably familiar with the
[GraphQL directives (`@aws_subscribe`, `@aws_auth`, etc.)](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli-legacy/graphql-transformer/directives/)
that are used to define the GraphQL schema or models.

While building your GraphQL schema within the AWS AppSync console, you don't need to define those
directives. However, when you try to publish your schema to Hive, you will notice that those
directives are missing, and schema is marked with errors.

You can use the **Schema Extensions** feature to define a pre-defined schema that is automatically
merged with your published schemas, before being checked and validated.

[You can find here the directive and scalar SDL needed for AWS AppSync](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-inspector/blob/d0efec031b64aae94818d749b697e73276f0f239/packages/loaders/loaders/src/index.ts#L57-L82)

### Change slug of a target

You can easily change the slug of your targets in Hive by adjusting the settings of your target.

To do this, go to the **Settings** tab of your target, and use the **Target Slug** form.

<Callout type="warning">
  Changing the slug of your target will also change the target's URL, and will invalidate any
  existing links to your target.
</Callout>

### Delete a target

As the owner of an organization, you have the option to delete a target, including all targets,
settings and all data collected during your use of Hive.

To delete an target, go to the **Settings** tab of your target, and use the **Delete Target**
section.

<Callout type="warning">This action is not reversible!</Callout>

## Manage Tokens

Under a target's **Settings** page, you can manage two different types of tokens:

### Registry Access Tokens

**Registry Access Tokens** are used to access to Hive Registry and perform actions on your
targets/projects. In most cases, this token is used from the Hive CLI.

Under the **Registry Access Tokens** section, click the **Generate new token** button. Give your
access token a either select a predefined preset for your token (under **Simple** view), or create a
token with custom permissions (under **Advanced** view).

![Create Registry Token Form](/docs/pages/guides/token.png)

Click on **Generate Token** button, and you should get your CLI token created, with permissions to
publish GraphQL schemas.

![Created Token](/docs/pages/management/target-created-token.png)

Make sure to copy your token and keep it safe. **You won't be able to see it again.**

<Callout type="info">
  **Note:** You can create multiple tokens with different permissions for different use cases.
</Callout>

### CDN Access Tokens

#### Creating a CDN Access Token

The Hive Cloud service leverages the
[CloudFlare Global Network](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/) to deliver your GraphQL schema and
schema metadata. This means that your schema will be available from the nearest location to your
GraphQL gateway, with 100% uptime, regardless of Hive's status. This ensures that everything
required for your GraphQL API is always available, and reduces the risk of depending on Hive as a
single point of failure. [You can read more about Hive's CDN here](/docs/high-availability-cdn).

Managing your **CDN Access Token** is located under your target's **Settings** page.

Click on **Create new CDN Token** to create a new CDN token. Describe your token with an alias, and
click **Create**.

In most cases, CDN Access Tokens are used directly from other tools, like a gateway, so please store
this access token securely. **You will not be able to see it again.**

<Callout type="info">
**Why are Registry and CDN tokens different?**

We use a separate, externally managed storage to manage CDN tokens to ensure high availability of
your schemas. This approach ensures that your GraphQL schemas are fully secured and highly
available. CDN tokens are read-only and can only fetch schemas from the CDN. They do not have
permissions to perform any other action on your Hive organization.

</Callout>

#### Revoking a CDN Access Token

In case of a security breach, you can revoke a CDN Access Token by clicking on the **Revoke** button
in the list of CDN tokens.

<Callout type="info">
  Revoking CDN access token can take up to 5 minutes to update across the CDN network.
</Callout>
