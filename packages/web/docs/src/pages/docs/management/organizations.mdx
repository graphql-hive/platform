# Organization Management

A Hive **organization** is a group of users who share a common set of permissions, or who
collaborate on GraphQL APIs. Hive organizations are used to manage access, integrations, and
billing.

## Create a new organization

To create a new organization, [you use this page directly](https://app.graphql-hive.com/org/new).

Alternatively, you can create a new Hive organization by clicking on your user profile and selecting
**Switch organization**. From there, click on the **Create an organization** button.

![Creating an organization](/docs/pages/management/create-an-organization-button.png)

Follow the instructions and choose a unique slug for your organization:

## Manage existing organization

### Members

Under your organization's **Settings** page, you can manage, add, and remove members from your Hive
organization.

![Members of an Organization](/docs/pages/management/org-members.png)

To invite others to your organization, go to **Members** tab under your organization. To invite a
new member to your organization, write their email address and click on **Send an invite** button.

![Invite Member to Organization](/docs/pages/management/org-invite-member.png)

The new member will receive an email inviting them to join Hive as a user, and this will add them as
a member to your Hive organization.

Once an invite has been created, you can also copy the personal invite link and share it directly
using your preferred method:

#### Roles

There are two types of system roles in organizations: **Admin** and **Viewer**, but you can also
define **custom roles**.

![List of Roles](/docs/pages/management/org-roles.png)

Custom roles can be created to provide more granular access to your organization's resources.

### Integrations

On your organization's **Settings** page, navigate to the **Integrations** section to manage
integrations with other services.

#### Slack

The integration of Hive and Slack is an incredibly useful tool that can help you streamline your
workflow and increase productivity. By using this integration, you can receive alerts and
notifications directly in your Slack channels, allowing you to stay on top of important changes to
your GraphQL schemas.

Additionally, this integration can help you to collaborate more effectively with your team members,
as you can share information and updates in real-time, ensuring that everyone is on the same page.

![Hive and Slack Integration](/docs/pages/management/org-slack-integration.png)

To activate this feature in your organization, go to the **Integrations** section of your
**Settings** page, and click **Connect Slack** button. You'll get redirected to **Slack** to
authorize and approve the Slack App installation.

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure to select the channels you plan to send messages to on the Slack authorization page.
</Callout>

Now follow the instructions on [Project Management](/docs/management/projects#channels) page to
connect between a Hive **project** and the actual Slack channel, and choose the alerts and
notifications you would like to receive.

#### GitHub

Integrating Hive and GitHub will provide your GitHub repositories with additional information about
GraphQL schema checks and pushes, and will integrate
[GitHub's Check Suite](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/checks/suites?apiVersion=2022-11-28) feature
with Hive.

To activate this feature in your organization:

1. Go to the **Github Integration** section of your organization's **Settings** page
2. Click **Connect GitHub** button.

You'll get redirected to **GitHub** to authorize and approve the GitHub App installation.

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure to select the GitHub repositories you plan to run Hive CLI in. If you use the Hive CLI
  from multiple GitHub repositories (e.g. for a federated Graph), you'll need to grant access to
  each of those, otherwise the publishes or schema checks will fail.
</Callout>

Now follow the instructions on [Project Management](/docs/management/projects#github-repository)
page to connect between a Hive CLI and the GitHub repository.

#### SSO with OIDC (OpenID Connect)

Hive supports integrating with OIDC providers, such as Auth0, Okta, Google Workspaces, Azure AD
(Active Directory), Keycloak and others.

Connecting an OIDC provider to this organization allows users to automatically log in and be part of
this organization.

Follow the instructions on the [SSO with OIDC guide](/docs/management/sso-oidc-provider) for more
information about this type of integration.

### Subscription and Billing

Hive offers a free tier for all users, and a paid tier for organizations that needs more data
storage to store large volume of GraphQL operations sent through
[Usage Reporting](/docs/schema-registry/usage-reporting) feature.

To manage your plan and subscription, use the **Subscription** tab under your organization's page.
From there, you can upgrade your plan, view invoices, change your payment method, and cancel your
subscription at any time.

If you wish to upgrade your plan, you can choose between the **Pro** and **Enterprise** plans.

For the **Pro** plan, you can use a credit-card and pay monthly for the reserved quota that works
for your needs. You can modify your plan and reserved quota any time during the month.

<a
  className="_text-primary-600 mt-6 block cursor-pointer"
  onClick={() => window.$crisp?.push(['do', 'chat:open'])}
>
  For the **Enterprise** plan, please reach our to us, and we'll be happy to help you with your
  custom needs.
</a>

#### How do I update my billing information?

<Tabs items={['Hobby', 'Pro', 'Enterprise']}>

  <Tabs.Tab>
   1. Go to the **Subscription** tab under your organization's page.
   2. Click on **Manage Subscription**.
   3. Click on **Stripe Billing dashboard**.
   4. Go to **Billing Information** section and click on **Update Information**.

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

    2. Create a **new ticket**.
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Change slug of organization

Slug is a unique identifier for your organization, and a URL namespace on GraphQL Hive.

You can change the slug of your organization by visiting **Settings** tab of your organization, and
using the **Organization Slug** form.

<Callout type="warning">
  Changing the slug of your organization will affect the organization URL, and will invalidate any
  existing links to your organization.
</Callout>

### Transfer Ownership

When you create a new organization, you become its owner by default. While you can invite others to
be members of your organization, transferring ownership to another user requires utilizing the
**Transfer Ownership** option found under the **Settings** tab.

Once you fill the form with the email address of the new owner, the new owner will receive a
confirmation email.

If the new owner doesn't accept the transfer within 24 hours, the invitation will expire.

When you transfer an organization to one of the members, the **new owner** will get access to
organization's contents, projects, members, and settings.

<Callout type="info">
  **You** will keep your access to the organization's contents, projects, members, and settings,
  except you won't be able to remove the organization.
</Callout>

### Delete an organization

As the owner of an organization, you have the option to delete the entire organization, including
all projects, targets, membership information, and all data collected during your use of Hive.

To delete an organization, go to the **Settings** tab of your organization, and use the **Delete
Organization** section.

<Callout type="warning">This action is not reversible!</Callout>
