The laboratory GraphiQL playground now saves the query and variables state in the browser. This
means that you can now refresh the page and the query and variables will be preserved.

We've also added a new button to the playground that allows you to discard the query and variables
state, as well as an indicator that shows when the state needs to be saved.
