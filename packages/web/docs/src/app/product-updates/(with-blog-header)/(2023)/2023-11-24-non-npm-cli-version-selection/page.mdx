Good news, non-NPM users! We've just released a new version of GraphQL Hive which introduces the
ability to install a specific version of the CLI!

Now, you have the flexibility to choose and install the exact version you need for your projects.
Whether you have specific compatibility requirements or simply prefer working with a particular
release, we've got you covered.

To install a specific version, use one of the following methods:

1. Using the version as an argument:

```bash
curl -sSL https://graphql-hive.com/install.sh | sh -s "0.31.0"
```

2. Setting the `HIVE_CLI_VERSION` environment variable:

```bash
curl -sSL https://graphql-hive.com/install.sh | HIVE_CLI_VERSION="0.31.0" sh
```

or

```bash
export HIVE_CLI_VERSION="0.31.0"
curl -sSL https://graphql-hive.com/install.sh | sh
```

We believe that this enhancement will streamline your development workflow and provide you with the
precision and control you need. As always, we appreciate your feedback, so feel free to share your
thoughts and experiences with us.
