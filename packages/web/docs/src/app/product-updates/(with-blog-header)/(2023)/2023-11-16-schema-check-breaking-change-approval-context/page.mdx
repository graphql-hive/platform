Breaking change approvals are now retained in the context of a pull request/branch.

In the schema check details, we now display the user that approved a breaking chang.

Also, approvals and breaking changes that are safe based on usage data are now always shown within
the breaking changes section instead of being moved to the safe changes section.

<Callout>
  Benefiting from this feature requires **upgrading to the `@graphql-hive/cli` version `0.31.0`**.
</Callout>

If you use GitHub repositories and GitHub actions via the `--github` flag, no further action is
required, aside from upgrading the CLI.

For other CI providers, you need to update your CI configuration to pass the `--contextId` option
for the `hive schema:check` command. We recommend to use the pull/merge request number or branch
name as the context ID.

```bash
hive schema:check --contextId "pull-request-21" ./my-schema.graphql
```
