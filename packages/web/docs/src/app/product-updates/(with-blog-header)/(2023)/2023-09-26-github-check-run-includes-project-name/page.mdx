A subtle but important change for Github users. In newly created projects, a check-runs name
includes the name of the project. We added it, to prevent naming collisions when checking against
multiple projects with the same target name.

**Before**
![Github check-run without project name](/changelog/2023-09-26-github-check-run-includes-project-name/before.png)

**After**
![Github check-run with project name](/changelog/2023-09-26-github-check-run-includes-project-name/after.png)

To avoid introducing a breaking change, Hive adds the project name only to newly created projects,
the existing projects can be migrated with a click of a button.

**Go to project's settings, find a section with Github and click "I want to migrate".**
