It is now possible to link more than one GitHub repository to individual schema checks and schema
versions. This allows you to connect multiple GitHub repositories to a single target, which is
mandatory for Federated GraphQL schemas, where subgraphs are distributed across multiple
repositories.

## How to link a GitHub action repository to a schema check

In order to leverage this new feature you need to upgrade the Hive CLI to the latest version, no
further changes are required.

## My project was already linked to a GitHub repository, what do I need to do?

Previously, we linked a single GitHub repository to a target within GraphQL Hive. This is no longer
the case, and you can now link multiple GitHub repositories to a single target. All you need to do
is grant access to the GitHub repositories within the organization settings. Then, within the target
settings, you will see a list of repositories that can be linked.
