Schema Check is a powerful feature that allows you to validate schema changes before they are
applied to your production environment. It's a great way to catch potential issues early and prevent
breaking changes from reaching your customers.

Today, we're introducing a small but useful improvement to Schema Check approvals.

**You can now add a comment when approving a breaking change.** This comment will be visible to your
team members, giving them more context about the approval.

We also improved visibility of the approvals, so you can quickly spot who accepted the changes and
what was the justification.

We hope this little feature will make a significant improvement in your workflow.
