Introducing the **Deprecated GraphQL Schema View**, designed to assist you in maintaining the
GraphQL schema and securely removing any deprecated types, fields and arguments.

Navigate to the `Explorer`, where you'll now discover a convenient new option labeled Deprecated.
Simply click on it to access an overview of all deprecated components within your schema.

Each deprecated field, alongside its deprecation reason, has a usage column. This section provides
invaluable insights into the frequency and context of usage for each deprecated field, helping you
to make informed decisions about their removal.

Furthermore, Explorer has received an upgrade - it now displays a deprecation message upon hovering
over any deprecated field, improving visibility and assisting in proactive schema management.
