We're excited to announce that the [**App Deployments**](/docs/other-integrations/apollo-router)
feature is now available for Apollo Router!

## App Deployments / Persisted Documents

App Deployments (persisted documents) are a way to group and publish your GraphQL operations as a
single app version to the Hive Registry. This allows you to keep track of your different app
versions, their operations usage, and performance.

To use App Deployments with Apollo Router, follow the
[installation instructions](/docs/other-integrations/apollo-router), and use the latest image
version (`router1.58.0-plugin1.1.0`) of the
[custom build of Apollo Router](/docs/other-integrations/apollo-router).

Push your GraphQL operations to the App Deployments store, and then configure Apollo-Router with the
`hive.persisted_documents` plugin:

```yaml filename="router.yaml"
# ... the rest of your configuration
plugins:
  hive.usage: {}
  hive.persisted_documents:
    enabled: true
```
