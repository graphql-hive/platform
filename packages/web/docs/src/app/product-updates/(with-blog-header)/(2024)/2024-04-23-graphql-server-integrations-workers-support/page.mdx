Exciting News!

We're thrilled to reveal two updates today: library-specific packages and support for Cloudflare
Workers.

## Enhanced integration with GraphQL servers

We heard your feedback, and we're always looking for ways to improve Hive. Providing a single
package for all GraphQL server libraries can be challenging, especially when it comes to type
safety.

To address this, **we're introducing library-specific packages**. These packages are designed to
seamlessly integrate with your GraphQL server of choice, improving the developer experience.

<Callout type="warning">
  As part of this update, we'll be sunsetting the @graphql-hive/client package in favor of new
  specialized packages.

## Cloudflare Worker Support

We're delighted to announce that Hive now fully supports Cloudflare Workers. Thanks to making the
core package node-agnostic, you can now use Hive in your Cloudflare Workers projects.

We recommend leveraging [GraphQL Yoga](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server) with Cloudflare
Workers as it provides an excellent developer experience and is well-suited for serverless
environments with the Fetch API.

```typescript filename="worker.ts"
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { createHive, useHive } from '@graphql-hive/yoga'

export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    const hive = createHive({
      enabled: true, // Enable/Disable Hive Client
      token: env.HIVE_TOKEN,
      usage: true // Collects schema usage based on operations,
      autoDispose: false,
    })

    const yoga = createYoga({
      plugins: [useHive(hive)]
    })

    const response = await yoga.fetch(request, env, ctx)
    ctx.waitUntil(hive.dispose())
    return response
  }
}
```
