We've recently released a stable `v1` release of our Hive plugin for Apollo Router!

For detailed integration instructions, visit our
[Apollo Router integration documentation](/docs/other-integrations/apollo-router).

## Version Structure

Our versioning follows the pattern `routerX.Y.Z-pluginX.Y.Z`, combining both the core
[Apollo Router](https://crates.io/crates/apollo-router) and
[Hive plugin](https://crates.io/crates/hive-apollo-router-plugin) versions. For example:
`router1.57.1-plugin1.0.0`.

## Installation Options

### Docker Image

Pull from our GitHub Packages registry:

```bash
# Latest version
docker pull ghcr.io/graphql-hive/apollo-router:latest

# Specific version (recommended for production)
docker pull ghcr.io/graphql-hive/apollo-router:router1.57.1-plugin1.0.0
```

> **Important:** For production deployments, always use a specific version tag rather than `latest`
> to ensure stability and predictability.

Browse all available versions in our
[releases registry](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/pkgs/container/apollo-router).

For running instructions, see our [Docker usage guide](/docs/other-integrations/apollo-router).

### Binary Installation

Download Apollo Router with Hive plugin for Linux (`x86_64`), macOS (`x86_64`), or Windows
(`x86_64`):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://graphql-hive.com/apollo-router-download.sh | bash
```

You may also specify a version using the `-v` or `--version` flag:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://graphql-hive.com/apollo-router-download.sh | bash -s -- --version router1.57.1-plugin1.0.0
```

For setup instructions, see our [binary deployment guide](/docs/other-integrations/apollo-router).

Browse all available versions in our
[releases registry](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/pkgs/container/apollo-router).

### Rust Integration (Crate)

The Hive plugin is available as a standalone crate:

```toml
[dependencies]
hive-apollo-router-plugin = "1.0.0"  # Replace with latest version
```

If you were previously using the Hive plugin crate via `git`, update it to the latest version:

```toml
[dependencies]
# Before:
# hive-apollo-router-plugin = { git = "...", branch = "main", rev = "..." }
# After:
hive-apollo-router-plugin = "1.0.0"
```

Find the package and all release versions on
[Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/hive-apollo-router-plugin).
