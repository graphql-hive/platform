The schema checks will now show you the top affected operations and clients based on the conditional
breaking change configuration of the target for each schema change.

![Picture of top operations and clients for schema change](/changelog/2024-02-26-schema-check-top-affected-operations/schema-check-top-operations-clients.png)

This gives you a better understanding of the impact of your changes before you approve or reject a
schema check.

To see the top affected operations and clients, you need to have the usage reporting and conditional
breaking changes enabled for your target.
