**TL;DR** We release Hive Gateway v1.0.0, a new [GraphQL Federation](/federation) Gateway that
seamlessly integrates with the Hive Schema Registry.
[Check out our new Gateway documentation](/docs/gateway).

Hive Gateway is our fully open source and MIT-licensed GraphQL Gateway with native support for
GraphQL Federation.

Hive Gateway is built on top of our existing and widely used open-source packages such as
[GraphQL Yoga](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server) and
[GraphQL Tools](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/tools).

With Hive Gateway you get access to the following features, that are currently behind a paywall in
other gateway/router solutions.

- [GraphQL Subscriptions](/docs/gateway/subscriptions)
- [Persisted Documents](/docs/gateway/persisted-documents)
- GraphQL API Usage and Analytics Reporting
- [Authentication and Authorization](/docs/gateway/authorization-authentication)
- [Role-based Access Control](/docs/gateway/authorization-authentication#rolescope-based-authentication-rbac-with-requiresscope-directive)
- Observability with [Open Telemetry and Prometheus](/docs/gateway/monitoring-tracing)

We don't believe in gate-keeping essential features, and want to make them accessible to everyone.

[getting started guide for Apollo Federation](/docs/get-started/apollo-federation) or immediately

You can learn more about our decision to split the
[GraphQL Mesh](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/mesh) and [Hive Gateway](/docs/gateway) projects in our
blog post -
