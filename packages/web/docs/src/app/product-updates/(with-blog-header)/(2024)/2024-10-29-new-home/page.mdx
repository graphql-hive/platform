In our latest update, we've made some structural changes by moving our repositories and Docker
images to the newly created [`github.com/graphql-hive`](https://github.com/graphql-hive)
organization on GitHub.

## GitHub Repositories

We've moved our main Hive repository from
[`kamilkisiela/graphql-hive`](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-hive) to
[`graphql-hive/platform`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/platform). Additionally, the Hive Gateway
has been extracted from [`ardatan/graphql-mesh`](https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-mesh) and can
now be found at [`graphql-hive/gateway`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/gateway).

Previously, our repositories were spread across multiple organizations and users. Now you can find
all Hive repositories in one place, making it easier to navigate and contribute.

Give us a star on GitHub to show your support and stay up-to-date with the latest changes!

## Docker Images

For those using our Docker images, we've move them as well.

All images are now available under the
[`ghcr.io/graphql-hive`](https://github.com/orgs/graphql-hive/packages) namespace on GitHub
Container Registry.

**Hive (self-hosted)**

If you self-host Hive, please update your Docker files to the new image paths:

```diff
- ghcr.io/kamilkisiela/graphql-hive/<image-name>
+ ghcr.io/graphql-hive/<image-name>

- ghcr.io/kamilkisiela/graphql-hive/emails
+ ghcr.io/graphql-hive/emails
```

<Callout type="info">
  We recently began versioning the components of self-hosted Hive to enhance stability and upgrade
  management. [Read more about versioning
  here](/product-updates/2024-10-29-versioning-for-self-hosters).
</Callout>

**Hive-flavored version of Apollo Router**

Many of you use our customized Apollo Router with Hive-specific features built in.

```diff
- ghcr.io/kamilkisiela/graphql-hive/apollo-router
+ ghcr.io/graphql-hive/apollo-router
```

**Hive Gateway**

For those using
[our GraphQL Gateway](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/product-updates/2024-09-09-hive-gateway),
be sure to update the image path as well.

```diff
- ghcr.io/ardatan/hive-gateway
+ ghcr.io/graphql-hive/gateway
```

The old Docker images remain available but will no longer receive updates.
