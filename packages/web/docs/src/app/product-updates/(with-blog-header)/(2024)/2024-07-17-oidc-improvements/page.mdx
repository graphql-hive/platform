GraphQL Hive supports Single-Sign-On (SSO) via OpenID Connect (OIDC) for a long time now. We heard
your feedback and added some improvements to make it even better.

## Organization Access for OIDC Users Only

With this update, you can now restrict organization access exclusively to OIDC users. This ensures
that only users authenticated via your OIDC provider can access your organization, providing an
extra layer of security.

This restriction is enabled by default for all new and existing organizations, but you can disable
it at any time in the organization's settings (see the screenshot above).

## Improved Sign-In Flow

You can now select the **Login with SSO** option and enter your organization's slug to log in to
GraphQL Hive using your OIDC provider. We believe this change provides a more user-friendly
experience. The existing method of logging in via a unique link is still available.

Thank you for your continuous feedback and support. We hope these improvements make your experience
with GraphQL Hive even better. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach
out to us.
