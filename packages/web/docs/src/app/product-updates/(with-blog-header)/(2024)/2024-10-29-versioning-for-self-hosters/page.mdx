In response to community feedback, we've started versioning the Docker images used for self-hosting
Hive! Previously, the lack of versioning made it challenging to keep self-hosted instances
consistent and up-to-date, but now managing your setup is easier than ever.

You can find the latest versions of Hive Docker images on the
[releases](https://github.com/graphql-hive/platform/releases) page and in the
[`deployment/CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/platform/blob/main/deployment/CHANGELOG.md)
file in the [`graphql-hive/platform`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/platform) repository.

Stay tuned as we continue to make Hive even more easier for self-hosting!
