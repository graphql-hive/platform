We added support for live streaming the OoenID Connect logs in the Hive Dashboard. This feature is
available to organization admins and allows them to debug OpenID Connect logs in real-time.

This feature is especially useful when you need to troubleshoot issues with your OpenID Connect
provider, which previously required to contact the Hive support team. Now, you can access the logs
directly in the Hive Dashboard and debug issues regarding the OpenID Connect provider yourself.

To access the OpenID Connect logs, navigate to the **Settings** tab in your organization dashboard
and click the "Show Debug Logs" button in the OpenID Connect section.
