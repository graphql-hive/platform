                As GraphQL APIs grow, they become harder to maintain. Teams step on each other's
                toes, deployments get risky, and making changes becomes slow.
              </p>
              <p>
                GraphQL federation solves these issues by letting you break down your monolithic
                GraphQL API into smaller parts, called subgraphs. Each team can work on their domain
                independently and deploy at their own pace.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thanks to the process called schema composition, the integrity of those subgraphs is
                validated and their schemas are combined into one unified schema, the supergraph.

                GraphQL clients interact with a single http endpoint served by GraphQL gateway
                (often called GraphQL router) that resolves data of your federated API.

            GraphQL federation is perfect for <strong>domain-driven design</strong> or when you want
            to write GraphQL APIS in <strong>different languages</strong>. It allows teams to
            contribute data from their isolated GraphQL APIs (subgraphs) to the shared space called{' '}
            <strong>Supergraph</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This way, each team can focus on their domain and iterate faster, without being blocked
            by other teams.

            {/* Federated GraphQL API involves three components: subgraphs, composition and a gateway. */}
            GraphQL Federation creates a unified API thanks to three key components: subgraphs
            (individual service APIs), a composition layer that validates and combines schemas, and
            a gateway that routes client requests across the distributed system.

              <p>
                GraphQL federation revolutionizes API development through subgraphs - standalone
                GraphQL APIs that form its foundation. In a GraphQL federation architecture, each
                subgraph can be <strong>developed in any language or framework</strong> and{' '}
                <strong>deployed independently</strong> from other components, making it a powerful
                choice for modern applications.
              </p>
              <h4>Defining Subgraph Schemas</h4>
              <p>
                GraphQL federation enables subgraphs to contribute fields to shared types through
                the <code>@key</code> directive.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the presented example, both subgraphs define the <code>Product</code> type with a
                shared <code>id</code>
                field marked by <code>@key(fields: "id")</code>. The "products" subgraph does not
                own the <code>Product</code> type, it contributes the <code>name</code> and{' '}
                <code>price</code> fields. Meanwhile, the "reviews" subgraph extends this type by
                contributing the <code>reviews</code> field.
              </p>
              <p>
                This powerful feature allows teams to evolve their portions of the schema
                independently while maintaining a cohesive API. When a client queries for a
                <code>Product.reviews</code>, the federation layer automatically combines data from
                both subgraphs using the <code>id</code> as the joining key.
              </p>
              <h4>Comparing Federation to Monolithic GraphQL API</h4>
              <p>
                Unlike traditional monolithic GraphQL APIs where teams are constrained to a single
                codebase, language, and tech stack, GraphQL federation offers flexibility. While
                monolithic approaches do provide benefits through shared knowledge and easier team
                collaboration, they come with significant limitations that GraphQL federation
                specifically addresses.
              </p>
              <p>
                The challenges of monolithic GraphQL APIs include slower development cycles due to
                deployment queues, and reduced reliability where a single change can impact the
                performance or stability of the entire API. GraphQL federation transforms these pain
                points by introducing a more modular approach where each team gains control over
                their portion of the API.
              </p>
              <p>Key advantages of GraphQL federation include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Teams maintain complete control over their specific GraphQL API domains</li>
                <li>Teams choose their preferred development stack</li>
                <li>Each subgraph can be updated on its own schedule</li>
                <li>Resources can be allocated precisely where needed</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                By implementing GraphQL federation, organizations can break free from monolithic
                constraints while maintaining the benefits of a unified GraphQL API.

                Schema composition is the pillar of GraphQL federation, enabling you to build a

                schema, called the supergraph schema.

                <strong>
                  Supergraph represents the complete, combined graph of all your subgraphs
                </strong>
                . It acts as a blueprint of your entire federated GraphQL API, showing how different
                subgraphs connect and interact. Think of the supergraph as your GraphQL API's source
                of truth - it defines all available types, fields, and their relationships.

                What makes GraphQL federation unique is its comprehensive schema validation. The

                  The core promise of GraphQL federation is to have a unified API and serve data

                </strong>{' '}
                GraphQL gateway, also known as a GraphQL router, enables that.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a federated GraphQL setup, the gateway uses a supergraph schema to retrieve
                information about the type and field definitions, as well as the subgraphs that
                resolve them.
              </p>
              <h4>Query Planning</h4>
              <p>
                The process of resolving GraphQL requests by the gateway is called query planning.
              </p>
              <p>When the gateway receives a request, it:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Analyzes the incoming GraphQL query</li>
                <li>Determines which subgraphs are responsible for different fields</li>
                <li>Orchestrates parallel requests to relevant subgraphs</li>
                <li>Aggregates returned data into a single response</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Essential Features of a Federation Gateway</h4>
              <p>
                GraphQL gateway is a critical part of your federated GraphQL setup as it's the entry
                point for all your GraphQL clients. It has to be fast, reliable and secure.
              </p>
              <p>
                A production-ready GraphQL gateway should offer features like authentication with
                JSON Web Tokens (JWT), role-based access control (RBAC), and a good observability
                story. It should be able to handle a large amount of requests.
              </p>
              <h4>Specification Compliance</h4>
              <p>
                A critical yet{' '}
                <strong>

              </p>
              <p>
                When choosing a federation gateway, verify its compliance with the Apollo Federation
